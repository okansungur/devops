- CI and CD are similar, but there are some differences between these practices. CI concentrates on integrating the software with every commit. This occurs after unit testing.
- CD extends CI, because it adds another layer after integration and testing of the software are complete. CD builds the software and prepares it for potential release.
- CI places a big emphasis on the testing phase. This is very important for CI, in particular when code is merged with the main branch. The goal of CI is not to lose functionality after the merge.
- On the other hand, CD places great emphasis on building software
